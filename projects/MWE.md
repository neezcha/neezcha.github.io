Mars Water Extraction (MWE) is an ongoing project created and lead by Agnes Straatman, mentored by Dr. Aaron Hanai, Dr. Dilmurat Azimov, and Li-Anne Delavega. The focus of this project is to analyze existing research and compile the information into specific locations for future pursuit on Mars regarding water.

To do this we made a decision matrix focusing on the probability of water, the possibility of life, regional topography, past and current missions, and extraction technology. I was in charge of weather, mapping out mars, and focusing on regional topography of areas of interest regarding soil density, rover conditions, and landing radius. Our information primarily came from research papers discussing the large amounts of data found regarding a specific topic, and a few academic articles. This project helped me become much more comfortable reading and researching lengthy academic papers, even when aspects of the research are out of my scope of understanding I am still able to discern the main points and the information I need.

May 2018 we presented our findings at the HESTEMP conference where NASA representatives were present.

October 2018 we plan to present a proposal to NASA, regarding potential ideas/innovations for the 2020 Mars mission.
