SpaceMan is simple single player game. It is written in Java, using a previous student’s class EZ for graphics, and built in eclipse during my time in ICS 111 taught by Professor Jason Leigh.

In the game you are an astronaut in zero gravity, various problems pop up and it is up to you to collect the correct tool to solve any issue that comes your way.

I was in charge of the astronaut’s movements, using a state machine for the different images of the space explorer as they moved around the scene. I also worked on the menu, background sound, and background image. My teammates focused on the tools, the malfunctions, and together we worked on these three components interactions. It was a simple but cute game. During this project I learned how to incorporate and use code written by a team.
