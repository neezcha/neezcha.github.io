Space Man is simple single player game. It is written in Java, using a previous students class EZ for graphics, and built in eclips durrin my time in ICS 111 taught by Proffesor Jason Leigh. 

In the game you are an astronaught in zero gravity, various problems pop up and it is up to you to collect the correct tool to solve any issue that comes your way.

I was incharge of the astronaut's movements, using a state machine for the different images of the space exploer as they moved aorund the scene. I also worked on the menue, backgorund sound, and backgorund image. My team mates focoused on the tools, the malfunctions, and together we worked on these three components interactions. It was a simple but cute game.
