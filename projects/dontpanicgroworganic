The Lanikai Science Squad—four 7th grade students who formed an Ecybermission science team, identified a community problem: 98% of Hawaii farms are using synthetic pesticides on their crops. To protect the aina, they are found a more natural alternative to synthetic pesticide by making their own organic pest control. They discovered a low cost replacement for synthetic pesticide at $.13 per ounce, with natural ingredients including garlic and Hawaiian chili pepper. The data showed that organic pest control works just as well as synthetic pesticide in:
• preventing pests from damaging the crops
• encouraging crop growth
• growing with more chlorophyll, thought to be better for health

Homemade pest control made from organic materials maybe be a solution because it won’t harm humans or our environment in the process.

The Lanikai Science Squad competed in the Army Education Outreach Program (AEOP)'s eCyber Mission Competion (ECM) they won 7th grade first palce nationally, and a grant to help spread their findings to their comunity. I acted as a mentor to help the team fufil the requirmets of their grant. 

To help the girls stay organised and document their progress for the grant, I crated and manganged the website https://dontpanicgroworganic.org/ with wordpress.com. This site is a collection of the groups accomplishments form winning first palces nationally, the findings of their projet, and most of all the outreach they did with their community. One of the main asspects of the grant were the Organic Garden Starter Kits. As the name implies they are starter kits for gardenign organicly; they contain an instructional and informative pamphlet, seeds, "peet pellets" wich turn into soil, biodegradable pots, plant markers, and a spray bottle. These kits were passed out to individuals, gorups, and schools. The girls also did quite a bit of leg work, meeting with goverment offials, the Kokua Foundation, and attendig events. Throught this experience I helped guide the girls with budget planning, event cordinating, time manegement, as well being the photographer, video editor, and an extra pair of arms to help them carry things like the kits, brochures, or posters. 


The Organic Garden Starter Kit is made available for educational purposes.
