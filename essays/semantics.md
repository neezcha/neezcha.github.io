Communication is difficult, even for those who grew up speaking the same language. The nuances of the human experience expressed through words can have drastically different connotations depending on your syntactic choice. That is to say, there are many ways to say the same thing but they aren’t always interchangeable. A simple case of semantics can mean the difference between showing up to a “computer lab” with your laptop and notebook or attending a “computer workshop” where you build a computer and need goggles for soldering. Two words often used interchangeably, lab and workshop, create a different image and imply drastically different experiences. This conversational pitfall crosses over into the scientific and coding world.

A well known example of communication mishap, is NASA’s Mars Climate Orbiter that crashed. American’s use the Imperial Measuring System in day to day life, but most other places and the scientific community use the Metric Measuring System. When two separate parties were communicating vital information, they forgot their respective differences and a simple unit error sent a multi million dollar space probe crashing into a glorious blaze of miscommunication. In this situation, recalling the greek concepts of discourse may have saved NASA from an embarrassing flop. Often in STEM, people are so wrapped up in the Logos, logical reason and facts, of their message that they come across almost incoherently. This is because they have neglected Ethos, their credibility and professionalism, and Pathos, the intended audience. 

Poor spelling, shorthand text talk like using ‘u’ instead of ‘you’, and no return address will hurt the author's Ethos by undermining the intended message with, the alternative message “I could not be bothered to put effort into this and will not be bothered to put effort into reading your response.” A poorly addressed Ethos will create a poorly addressed Pathos. The intended audience will see the underlying message right away and be deterred from reading into the intended message. To strengthen an arguments Ethos and Pathos, professionalism is best. 

One place wrought with ineffective use of the English Language is the online forum. Misinterpretations of questions leading to seemingly unrelated answers, arguments for the same point but somehow aimed against each other, and issues unresolved because ‘no one was sure what the actual issue was’, are a few train wrecks that show up in these forums. Unfortunately or fortunately, these messy online platforms are a great well of knowledge waiting to be properly tapped. With well utilized Logos, Ethos, AND Pathos, many difficult or niche question can be answered. Upon further inspection, the post does well at acknowledging the effort the author has already put into solving this question, which boosts the author's Ethos and likelihood someone will take them seriously and give an intelligent answer.  

## Not everyone is perfect all the time, 
...and neither is anyone a complete disaster (usually).
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52219033/i-am-failing-when-i-try-to-use-scoped-slots-in-vue-js">  Stack Overflow question “I am failing when I try to use scoped slots in Vue.js” has a mix of effective and ineffective communication strategies. The main topic is stated and the thread is tagged appropriately. However, ‘I am failing’ is far to vague and tells the audience nothing about the actual issue, other than there is one. Ultimately the post lacks some key information, namely what exactly the issue or error is and what actions result in the error. This will make it difficult for anyone who even wants to try and answer to know where to start looking for issues, this is negligence of Pathos.

## A well worded title will draw in a relevant audience
A title good title contains the relevant keywords(instead of simply relying on the taggs), and states the specific desire or problem relating to the topic. Simply from a sufficient title a reader will know if they have the knowledge well to help solve the problem and will be much more inclined to further investigate. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2504071/how-do-i-combine-a-background-image-and-css3-gradient-on-the-same-element?rq=1"> StackOverflow question “How do I combine a background-image and CSS3 gradient on the same element?” demonstrates an practical title. Relevant ‘tagged’ words are incorporated into the title so there’s no puzzling to find out what the issue is regarding, and the desired outcome is clearly linked to the topic. The issue is implied to be a lack of knowledge, and explicit acknowledgement of that would be redundant in this case. 

## Precision of language is a necessity of effective communication
No matter your field you cannot truly escape some form of human interaction and with human interaction comes mistakes. “To err is human” (Alexander Pope, "Essay on Criticism"). There’s no need to beat yourself up over past mistakes because we all make them. Rather, this is an opportunity to look forward with your awareness of humanities inherent flaws, take them into consideration, and proceed with preparations for a smoother and more fruitful experience. We are all experiencing this life simultaneously in radically different ways, let's make this day easier on all of us!
