The hardest coding language to learn is the first language learned. This is probably because you're not just learning syntax but a new way of approaching and solving problems. Computers function systematically and have no concept of interpreting ambiguous statements. So any code written, must be unambiguous and methodical. To help ease the inevitable growing pains, UHM ICS department has chosen Java to be the starting language of fresh young coders. For me, the two main selling points of Java are the ubiquity of access by all users no matter the operating system, due to the virtual machine Java relies on, and intuitive syntax. Compared to a lower level language like C, which can access a devices memory directly, Java feels less risky.

*JavaScript* has capitalized on some of the best aspects of Java and attempt to cater to the user even more. This makes JavaScript the easiest language I have learned so far. It feels more flexible than Java and more forgiving than C. In JavaScript variables are characterized by their longevity rather than a specific type, which feels far more intuitive. For example, in JavaScript the variable markers are; ‘Const’ if the variable is a pillar of your community, ‘inst’ if your variable is transient and probably won't stick around long, and ‘var’ if you want to be vague and non committal. Meanwhile, Java would rather know they type of variable, ‘int’ or ‘String’ or what have you, and would also prefer to know the accessibility or range of the variable, ‘public’ or ‘private’ or ‘protected’, and only if you really want to will you address the variables integrity, whether it is ‘static’ or ‘final’ or whatnot. All these variable marks in Java may seem like more options but really they often serve as more restrictions. 

# WOD
### Software Engineering timed practices 
In the WODs done for ICS 314, we are asked to complete code for a given problem and finish within a certain timeframe. By not worrying about nitpicking the specific variable type, I feel that I am able to finish the WOD much faster. For example, a desired function has two expected parameters, in JavaScript my function code does not require me to specify what type of variables are to be passed as parameters. Of course we can write a few line to check if the inputted parameters match the type we require to properly execute the function but it is not imperative for the scope of a WOD. Too often in Java have I been tripped up between the subtle differences ‘double’, ‘int’, and ‘float’, and needed to revise my code by altering the variable types. This entire scenario is subverted in JavaScript since I can decide if there will be a decimal in the inputted parameter at the time of my function call. 

From a Software Engineering perspective this fluidity may be my pitfall, as there is potential to to introduce unintentional changes. I hope that the WODs and homework will help me improve my coding accuracy and speed. From the few WODs I have already participated in, I have noticed that the bulk of my code and the logic part is always completed by or under the recommended time. However, I have gone over time while searching for some small syntactical or spelling errors. Therefor meticulousness is clearly something I need to improve on, and I believe participating in more WODs will force me to do so.
