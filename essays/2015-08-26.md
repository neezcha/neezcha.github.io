I am currently a BS Computer Science student at The Univeristy of Hawai'i. I expect to graduate spring of 2020 but hope to continue my education past that date. I am very intrested in space travle, science, and technology but also convered about the state of our enviorment and social/cultral climate. This is why I feel that it is important to remember that technologies and innovations developed for specific functions, like space travel, can have practical purposes for imporoving the lives of people on Earth. For example, development of space efficient farming that maximizes nutritional balance humanâ€™s needs can help not only astronauts on long flights but people in countries with limited land space. I hope to carry this mindset into my own feild of computer science and using the skill I have learned, help create a more inclucive and diverse technological world. So that the lives of all people will improve but not disregard individual and cultral differences.
