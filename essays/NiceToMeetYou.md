I am currently a BS Computer Science student at The University of Hawai’i. I expect to graduate spring of 2020 but hope to continue my education past that date. I am very interested in space travel, science, and technology but also concerned about the state of our environment and social/cultural climate. This is why I feel that it is important to remember that technologies and innovations developed for specific functions, like space travel, can have practical purposes for improving the lives of people on Earth. For example, development of space efficient farming that maximizes nutritional balance of human’s needs can help not only astronauts on long flights but people in countries with limited land space. I hope to carry this mindset into my own field of computer science and using the skill I have learned, help create a more inclusive and diverse technological world. So that, the lives of all people will improve but not disregard individual and cultural differences.
