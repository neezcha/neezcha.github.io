## Patterns Everywhere!

Humans are incredibly good at finding patterns in the world around us. This can be adventitious, like back in the day, connecting a certain type of berry to people getting sick could save lives. It can also be dangerous, like when someone gets sick after a flu shot and becomes convinced that vaccinations are harmful. There are also patterns that mean nothing but still find fun, like potatoes shaped like a face.

Whatever your stance on vaccinations maybe, recognizing patterns has been one of humanity's greatest assets, along with opposable thumbs. As described above, patterns can help, can hurt, can be fun, and can be applied to all aspects of life. One aspect of life for me is coding, specifically software engineering this semester. One element of software engineering that can help a new coder advice farther and quicker, is Design Patterns as originally patented by Christopher Alexander in 1977. While the term was coined a very long time ago and the code examples used are mostly outdated, the concept of it can still be useful today. Design Patterns are based around the humans natural pattern seeking nature, as there are problems faced coders that seem to recur with the same core issues, instead of resolving these problems every time they arise, coders can reference pre well thought out solutions. This speeds up the coding process for newbies and experienced coders. In order to focus on the larger task at hand, it would be painful to continuously have to redesign solutions.

This isn't to say that these patterns are written on stone, rather, they are written on computers and can be changed to adapt to new languages, technologies, and discoveries. These patterns are a tool. Like avoiding poisonous berries, you can avoid manually hard coding in and out observes by using an observer's design pattern already well planned out to allow a one to many dependency without tight coupling.
 

# If we do not learn our history we are doomed to repeat it, but sometimes its good to repeat history
Back in the day aerosol cans became the hot new thing. Hair spray, lysol spray, face spray, everywhere. However, all the chemicals released from aerosol cans started to deplete the ozone protecting the earth from harmful radiation. Upon this horrific discovery, humanity as a whole made a conscious effort to reduce the usage of aerosol cans and the chemicals they emit. Then the ozone began to recover, saving countless lives from cancer. It is remarkable to think that this extreme change between the rise of aerosol, the depletion of the ozone layer, then the recovery of the ozone layer, all happens with a generations lifetime. There are people today who lived through all this in real time. Yes, there are still aerosol cans available today, but significantly less are used and produced. This piece of history, that feels like something spanning generations, that feel larger than any individual, was witnessed, experienced, and caused by a single generation. 
Today we face environmental change, caused by humans; we did not learn from our mistake but if we can learn from our solution we can still save the planet we live on. History is repeating on a large and small scale. We face environmental threats caused by us, we need to refresh a page on our website when a new button is clicked. Both have a general template of a solution that is applicable, take immediate and substantial action, use the well known Design Pattern Model-View-Controller. To make progress its ok to stand on the shoulders of giants and reach for higher levels, reach for a better world, reach for more efficient coding practices, reach for the future.
